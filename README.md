# Personal C Projects

This repository is dedicated to practicing C programming through small personal projects.  
The goal is to build useful, fun, or educational tools while deepening my understanding of the C language.

## Projects Completed So Far
- 🎲 **RNG Guessing Game** – A game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number.
- 📇 **Contact List App** – A basic address book that lets users add, edit, search, and delete contacts.
- ✅ **To-Do List App** – A console-based app for creating, editing, and removing tasks.

## Future Project Ideas
- 🌐 **WebSocket Implementation** – Implement a minimal WebSocket client/server in C.
- 🧮 **Simple Calculator** – A command-line calculator that handles basic arithmetic and expression parsing.
- 🧊 **File Encryption Tool** – Encrypt and decrypt text files using a basic algorithm like XOR or Caesar cipher.

I plan to continue to expand this repo with more C projects that explore data structures, system-level programming, and networking!
